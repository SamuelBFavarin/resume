[See in portuguese](https://github.com/SamuelBFavarin/SamuelBFavarin/blob/master/README.md)

I'm Samuel Favarin, I have a Bacharel Degree in Computer Science, and currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Conecta Nuvem. I started programming at 15 years old, and since then, I worked with many technologies for desktop, web, and mobile development. I worked with Delphi, C++, Java, Javascript (Jquery, Vue, Cordova, React Native), PHP, Python (Flask, Django, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas), MySQL, Postgress, Google Datastore, BigQuery, Google Cloud.

Today, I'm focusing to improve my code quality skills, applying unit tests, code refactoring, and design partners.

## My job projects :wrench:

In my career, I have worked on several projects, among which I like to highlight:

### Pulses Project ([Link](https://www.pulses.com.br/produtos/plataforma-pulses))
Pulses is a web tool to monitor the climate and the engagement of employees in organizations. In this project, I was responsible for the  Pulses Performance application development, using Cordova, Vue.js, and PHP. The application was hybrid and could be used on Android, IOS, and Web.

### Projeto Conecta Suite ([Link](https://app.conectasuite.com/login))
Conecta Suite is a web application designed to empower GSuite administrators with tools that facilitate the management of their users' accounts. The project was developed using Vue.js on the Front-end, Python (Flask) on the Back-end, and is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, using technologies such as App Engine, DataStore, Firebase Host, Cloud Functions, BigQuery, and Cloud Tasks.

### Projeto Pulses People Analytics ([Link](https://siaiap32.univali.br/seer/index.php/acotb/article/view/16722/0))
Applying data mining and artificial intelligence, I answered questions and created models to predict questions such as, "Attributes that most impact employee engagement", "Attributes that most impact employees to be happy" , " Factors that impact employee turnover ". I used Python with the libraries, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy. The project generated a publication on Computer on the Beach 2020.

## Open Source Projects (Highlights) :hammer:
### Presidentsum ([Link](https://presidentsum.com/))
Presidentsum is a tool that creates "Lorem Ipsum" with famous phrases from recent Brazilian and American presidents. It was developed with Vue.js.

### Gui Grafos ([Link](https://github.com/SamuelBFavarin/Grafos-GUI))
A web tool for education that provides a graphical interface to generate data structures in graphs and apply the classic algorithms. The project developed with Javascript.

### Face Detector ([Link](https://github.com/SamuelBFavarin/faceDetect))
Tool developed with Python and OpenCV to detect faces and apply fun filters in real-time.

## Achievements :trophy:

### TuApp 2015 finalist in Valparaíso, Chile
My team and I were finalists in the University Apps Tournament. We developed the MVP of an Android Application to help tourists find better sights, hotels, restaurants, and events.

### Paper in Computer on the Beach 2020
The project was developed jointly with Pulses and the University of the Itajaí Valley, to apply data mining and artificial intelligence techniques in the area of ​​people management. [Click here to view the paper](https://siaiap32.univali.br/seer/index.php/acotb/article/view/16722/0)

### Teacher of the course "Introduction to Python" and the course "Creating web applications with Flask".

The target audience was Computer Science, Internet Systems, and Computer Engineering students. The courses were hosted at UNIVALI in 2019.

### Talker in Conecta Talks
I did two internal talks at Conecta Nuvem, the first was "artificial intelligence and its applications" and the second "an introduction to programming logic".
